        <h2>What is My Favorite Game?</h2>
       <section> <p>Badminton is my favorite game because it's a fun and exciting sport that requires skill, agility, and precision. It can be played both competitively and recreationally, making it a great way to stay active and socialize with friends. I love the feeling of hitting the shuttlecock with just the right amount of power and angle to send it over the net and out of my opponent's reach. Badminton also has a rich history and is played all over the world, making it a truly global sport.</p></section>
